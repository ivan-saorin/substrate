# Documentation Enhancement Summary

## Problem Solved
Each server is now **self-documenting** through its own named tool, solving the discovery problem.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Enhanced Base Tool (`server.py`)
Every server now responds to its own name with comprehensive documentation:
- **Tool Name**: Same as server name (e.g., `tloen`, `uqbar`, `atlas`)
- **Returns**: Full documentation with usage, examples, and available tools

### 2. Instance-Specific Documentation
Each instance type has tailored documentation:

#### TLOEN
- Summary of platform formatting capabilities
- Usage patterns with code examples
- List of available site formats
- Navigation to common tasks

#### UQBAR  
- Persona and component overview
- Usage patterns for applying styles
- Available personas and components
- Examples of combinations

#### ATLAS (New)
- Master system overview
- All server descriptions
- Workflow guidance
- Quick action suggestions

#### SUBSTRATE
- Full documentation access
- Workflow navigation
- Reference management
- System architecture

### 3. Benefits

1. **Natural Discovery**
   - User: "How do I use tloen?"
   - LLM: Calls `tloen` tool
   - Result: Complete TLOEN documentation

2. **Self-Contained**
   - Each server explains itself
   - No need to know about substrate_documentation
   - Works for all instance types

3. **Smart Navigation**
   - Each response includes relevant next steps
   - Suggestions based on instance capabilities
   - Workflow integration

4. **Master Orchestrator**
   - Atlas instance provides system-wide view
   - Knows about all servers
   - Guides complex multi-server workflows

## Testing

After rebuilding the Docker image:
```bash
# Build
docker build -t substrate-mcp:latest .

# Test each instance
docker run -it --rm -e INSTANCE_TYPE=tloen ... substrate-mcp:latest
docker run -it --rm -e INSTANCE_TYPE=uqbar ... substrate-mcp:latest  
docker run -it --rm -e INSTANCE_TYPE=atlas ... substrate-mcp:latest
```

Then call each server by name to see its documentation.

## Migration for Other Servers

When implementing Phase 2 (AKAB) and Phase 3 (Synapse):
1. Add server documentation to base tool handler
2. Include usage examples specific to that server
3. List key capabilities and tools
4. Add navigation suggestions

This pattern ensures every server in the Atlas system is self-documenting and discoverable!

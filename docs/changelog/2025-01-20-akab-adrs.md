# ASR v2.0 Update: AKAB Phase 2 Architecture Decisions

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Author**: Ivan (via Claude)  
**Impact**: High - Critical architectural guidance for Phase 2

## Summary

Added comprehensive architectural decisions (ADRs 19-33) to support AKAB migration in Phase 2. These additions address AKAB's unique complexity as the most sophisticated server in the Atlas system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Principles Addition
- Added "Scientific Integrity First" principle
- Enforces truth over helpfulness for experimental tools
- References ADR-33 for implementation details

### 2. New Architecture Decisions (ADRs 19-33)

**State & Execution Management**:
- ADR-19: Stateful Feature Management
- ADR-20: Multi-Turn Conversation Handling
- ADR-24: Execution Engine Pattern
- ADR-29: Multi-Turn State Machine

**Integration & Architecture**:
- ADR-21: Cross-Feature Integration
- ADR-22: Complex Response Building
- ADR-23: Feature-Specific Utilities
- ADR-25: Progressive Loading Strategy

**AKAB-Specific Critical Requirements**:
- ADR-26: Isolated Data Directory Pattern ⚠️ CRITICAL
- ADR-27: Model Registry Migration ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE
- ADR-28: Triple-Blinding Architecture
- ADR-30: Provider Fail-Loud Pattern
- ADR-31: Archival and Unlocking System
- ADR-32: Cost Tracking Architecture
- ADR-33: Scientific Research Integrity Protocol ⚠️ CRITICAL

### 3. Phase 2 Section Updates
- Added critical warning about AKAB complexity
- Expanded migration checklist with pre-migration and validation steps
- Added scientific_integrity feature to structure
- Referenced new ADRs for architectural requirements

### 4. Migration Checklist Enhancements
- Pre-migration tasks (export campaigns, document formulas)
- Core migration expanded to 16 features
- Validation steps for scientific integrity
- Added 12 identified prompts to extract

## Impact

These additions ensure that anyone implementing AKAB migration will:
1. Understand the full complexity (103KB monolithic server)
2. Preserve triple-blinding architecture
3. Implement scientific integrity (truth over helpfulness)
4. Maintain all existing functionality
5. Follow clean architecture patterns from Phase 1

- AKAB current implementation analysis
- Substrate reference implementation (Phase 1)

## Next Steps
1. Begin AKAB migration following the enhanced guidance
2. Create detailed migration guide in `/docs/migration-guides/`
3. Set up /krill/ isolated directory structure
4. Start with Laboratory and Hermes extraction (Week 1)
